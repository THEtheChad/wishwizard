# Meteor Skeleton Template

This template is designed to replace the default meteor skeleton used for the `meteor create` command. Navigate to ~/.meteor/tools/__your_version__/tools and replace skel with this template.

You'll probably also want to run:
- meteor add accounts-base
- meteor add bootstrap-3

Don't forget to remove the .git folder and reinitalize the repo!
